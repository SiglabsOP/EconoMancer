Customizations
Adding New Keywords and Symbols
You can extend the keyword-to-symbol mapping by editing the assign_symbol_based_on_keywords function in main.py:

python
Code kopiÃ«ren
keyword_mapping = {
    "Lagarde": "EURUSD=X",
    "Fed": "^GSPC",
    # Add new mappings here...
}
Adjusting Event Scraping
Update the scraping logic in the scrape_economic_calendar function to use alternative sources or parse additional data fields.

A manual version has been included in case you want to pull html files manually and parse them.
Run news-generative to use full automated features (auto pull source, and auto parse)
